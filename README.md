# 🦷 DeepDent – AI-Powered Dental Imaging Toolkit

> 🚧 **Status:** Currently under development. This is a work-in-progress research and engineering project.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**DeepDent** is a next-generation AI toolkit designed to assist with dental diagnostics using panoramic radiographs (OPG images). It aims to detect pathological signs like tumors and cysts, analyze diagnostic features, and generate structured clinical-style reports — all within a secure, offline desktop application.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Detect dental tumors or cysts from panoramic X-ray images.
- Predict multiple diagnostic features for annotated regions.
- Generate detailed, printable PDF reports with visual explanations.
- Run securely in a privacy-friendly desktop application.

---

## 🔍 Core Components (In Progress)

- 📦 **Object Detection**: AI model for lesion localization.
- 🧪 **Multi-feature Prediction**: Custom CNN predicting up to 50 clinical attributes.
- 📊 **Explainability**: Integrated Grad-CAM, Score-CAM, and pixel attribution maps.
- 🖥️ **Desktop App**: Windows interface for doctors with full report export.
- 📄 **Automated Reports**: Structured diagnostic output (with optional language polishing).

---

## 💡 Use Case

Designed for dental clinics, labs, and research use cases where offline, explainable AI support can assist in reviewing panoramic images for secondary opinions or diagnostic aid.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- `Python`, `PyTorch`, `torchvision`, `Tkinter`
- `Grad-CAM`, `Captum`, `Jinja2`, `WeasyPrint`
- Optional: `OpenAI GPT-3.5` for natural language polishing
